                  I think Iâ€™ll start with something.
                  This is a modification of the game "snake" remastered on CMD.bat by Dave Benham (original http://www.dostips.com/forum/viewtopic.php?f&t=4741)
                  What is present in this modification?
                  1.gameplay remained unchanged
                  2. Added multiple difficulty options (veryInsane, RealyInsane and YouCrazy!?)
                  3.Exit button replaced with About
                  4. Added the ability to change the color of the Interface and a separate button to change the background
                  5.When starting the program ("snake" game), the Abouts file is created in the program folder
